And of course, we have some better things to do than just doing the same things over and over again.\r\n\r\nDoes this sounds familiar?\r\nMeet Capistrano, a tool to deploy web applications to one or more remote servers over SSH via just one single command!\r\n\r\nTips included for budget hosting (with SSH access).\r\n\r\nThis presentation is a nice follow up for the session about configuration management in Drupal.",
